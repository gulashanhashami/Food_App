# What did I Learn

- By end of this project, I am able to learn how effective work can be done as a solo when ideas are trajected in multiple spectrums.

- I learn many things includes, creating dynamic web page, map product data to show on web page and use API for product data.

- Effective learning involves how we were able to suggest constructive feedback on each otherâ€™s work and debug before we present our project.
